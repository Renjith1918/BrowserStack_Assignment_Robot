✅ API RESPONSE: {'Translated Content': 'The Camargue Delta, often idealized as a wild natural refuge, has been shaped for centuries by humans to make it habitable. According to an IPCC tool, with a 2.5°C rise, much of the Rhône Delta would be submerged. Towns like Aigues-Mortes and Arles would be underwater or by the sea. To understand how the inhabitants face this uncertain future, the author delves into their lives: people rooted in rural, rebellious, hunting, and agricultural traditions. Through portraits and poetic reflections, the text portrays a territory and its people facing the threat of disappearing.'}
